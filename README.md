## Title : An Approach to Predictive Policing with Dallas City

### ABSTRACT:

This repository contains data analysis with R on the reported police indcidents in the city of Dallas. The analysis covers answers to some basic queries -  uncovering some interesting facts and performs a first hand predictive model building that aids in forecasting the future occurences of crimes in terms of its kind and frequency.  

### WORK SUMMARY:
 1. Performing EDA on dataset to find answers to some basic queries from the observed patterns from the graph plots.
 2. Building the regression model that predicts frequency of crimes that could occur in a locality at a point in time. Further,   classification model also trained to predict the type of crime that could be occuring at a point in time and the region.
 3. Evaluation of the predictive models.

### DATASET:

Dataset that is used in the project is accessed from a replicated file repository in the [dropbox location](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ldxwrsyd10zx95/Police_Incidents.csv?dl=1). The original source of the dataset is [here](https://www.dallasopendata.com/Public-Safety/Police-Incidents/qv6i-rri7).
